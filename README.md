# Big Data Resources

Ready to use big data resources

## Directory structure

Normally you can find a ```README.md``` file in each folder explaining what is the content.
If you do not find that file I assume that the files explain themselves. For example: 
the ```docker-compose.yml``` files inside the docker folder explain what the configuration of the service itself is.

- docker # Here you can find the [dockers](https://www.docker.com/) of different services using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- domain # Here you can find examples/exercises already solved
- infrastructure # Here you can find [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) scripts to setup services in different clouds

### Usage

Wherever you see `$PROJECT_ROOT` it means the folder where this repo is located in your system.
